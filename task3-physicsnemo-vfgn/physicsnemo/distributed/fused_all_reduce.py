r"""All-reduce one or many tensors (or a TensorDict) in a single collective.

:func:`fused_all_reduce` packs one or many tensors - or a
:class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` (possibly nested) - into a single buffer, issues
one ``all_reduce``, and unpacks the result back into the caller's structure.
Inputs are detached, so it reduces values rather than gradients (it is not
autograd-aware); see the function docstring for the full contract.

    buffer_dtype : torch.dtype | None
        Explicit fused-buffer dtype (opt-in to any cast), or ``None`` to infer

    device : torch.device | str | None
        Device for the fused buffer / collective, or ``None`` to use the first
        tensor's device.
    async_op : bool
        If ``True``, launch the collective non-blocking and defer the unpack

    r"""All-reduce one or many tensors in a single collective, preserving structure.

    Combining *many* independent scalars or small tensors across ranks with one
    ``all_reduce`` per value is latency-bound. This helper instead flattens
    every value into a single buffer and performs **one** collective, then
    unpacks the result back into the same container type the caller passed in -
    a :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` (possibly nested), a
    :class:`~collections.abc.Mapping`, or a :class:`~collections.abc.Sequence`.

    ``op`` defaults to :attr:`~torch.distributed.ReduceOp.SUM`, matching
    :func:`torch.distributed.all_reduce`. Summing fused sums and counts and
    dividing ``sum / count`` afterwards (see Examples) is the building block for
    a sample-weighted mean that stays correct across uneven shards.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensors : torch.Tensor | TensorDictBase | Mapping[str, torch.Tensor] | Sequence[torch.Tensor]
        The tensors to reduce. The return type mirrors the input type: a single
        ``Tensor`` reduces to a single ``Tensor`` (the degenerate one-leaf case,
        mirroring :func:`torch.distributed.all_reduce`). Leaves may have
        heterogeneous shapes and dtypes; each output is returned on its leaf's
        original dtype and device.
    op : torch.distributed.ReduceOp, optional
        The reduction applied to every leaf, by default
        :attr:`~torch.distributed.ReduceOp.SUM`.
    group : torch.distributed.ProcessGroup | None, optional
        The process group to reduce over, by default ``None`` (the default,
        world-wide group).
    buffer_dtype : torch.dtype | None, optional
        Explicit dtype for the fused buffer. By default (``None``) the dtype is
        the promotion of all leaf dtypes (so e.g. ``float32`` + ``float64``
        accumulates in ``float64``), floored at ``float32`` for 16-bit floats
        (mirroring :func:`~physicsnemo.distributed.utils._reduce`); an
        all-integer bundle stays integer and reduces exactly, while mixing
        integer/bool with floating leaves raises ``ValueError`` instead of
        silently casting the integers through floating point (see Notes). Pass
        an explicit dtype to opt in to that cast - e.g. ``torch.float64`` to sum
        large-magnitude integer counts that would overflow ``float32``'s 24-bit
        mantissa.
    device : torch.device | str | None, optional
        Device for the fused buffer and collective, by default ``None`` (the
        first leaf's device). Outputs are always returned on their original
        per-leaf device regardless of this.
    async_op : bool, optional
        If ``True``, issue the fused collective asynchronously and return
        ``(result, work)``; the result's leaves hold each rank's local values
        until ``work.wait()`` completes the reduction and fills them in place
        (see :class:`_FusedAllReduceWork`). By default ``False`` (blocking),
        returning just ``result``.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor | TensorDictBase | dict[str, torch.Tensor] | list[torch.Tensor]
        The reduced tensors in the same structure as ``tensors``: a single
        ``Tensor`` for a ``Tensor`` input, a ``TensorDict`` (same, possibly
        nested, keys) for a ``TensorDict`` input, a ``dict`` (same keys, original
        order) for a ``Mapping`` input, or a ``list`` (same order) for a
        ``Sequence`` input. Every leaf retains its input shape, dtype, and
        device, and is detached and independent of the input. When
        ``async_op=True`` the return is instead a ``(result, work)`` tuple whose
        ``result`` is valid only after ``work.wait()`` (see ``async_op``).

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If ``tensors`` is not a ``Tensor``, ``TensorDict``, ``Mapping``, or
        ``Sequence``.
    ValueError
        If the inferred buffer dtype is floating point but some leaf is integer
        or boolean (which the cast would corrupt); pass ``buffer_dtype`` to opt
        in to the cast.

    Notes
    -----
    - **One collective.** All leaves are packed into a single contiguous buffer,
      so exactly one ``all_reduce`` is issued regardless of leaf count.
    - **Deterministic wire order.** ``Mapping`` / ``TensorDict`` keys are sorted
      before packing so every rank lays out the buffer identically; the result
      is returned in the caller's original key order.
    - **No-op fast path.** If ``torch.distributed`` is unavailable/uninitialized
      or ``world_size == 1``, detached clones are returned without any
      collective, so single-process runs are byte-identical.
    - **Not autograd-aware.** Inputs are detached, so gradients do not flow
      through the reduction (unlike the tensor-parallel primitive
      :func:`~physicsnemo.distributed.utils._reduce`).
    - **Integer-safe.** Integer/bool bundles reduce exactly in their own dtype;
      mixing them with floating leaves is refused (see Raises) rather than
      silently cast. An explicit ``buffer_dtype`` overrides this.
    - **Async.** With ``async_op=True`` the collective is non-blocking and the
      caller gets a ``(result, work)`` pair; call ``work.wait()`` before reading
      ``result`` to let the reduction land (mirrors
      :func:`torch.distributed.all_reduce`'s ``async_op``, and the in-repo
      ``distributed_transpose``).

    Examples
    --------
    Sample-weighted mean via fused sums and counts (the canonical use). On a
    single, uninitialized process this is a no-op reduction, so ``sum / count``
    simply recovers the local mean:

    >>> import torch
    >>> from physicsnemo.distributed import fused_all_reduce
    >>> reduced = fused_all_reduce(
    ...     {"loss_sum": torch.tensor(3.0), "count": torch.tensor(2.0)}
    ... )
    >>> float(reduced["loss_sum"] / reduced["count"])
    1.5

    When the per-rank shards are equal-weight, ``op=ReduceOp.AVG`` averages
    across ranks directly, with no separate count leaf. On a single process the
    reduction is a no-op, so the local value is returned unchanged:

    >>> import torch.distributed as dist
    >>> reduced = fused_all_reduce({"loss": torch.tensor(1.5)}, op=dist.ReduceOp.AVG)
    >>> float(reduced["loss"])
    1.5

    A single tensor reduces to a single tensor - the degenerate one-leaf case,
    mirroring :func:`torch.distributed.all_reduce`. On a single process this is
    a no-op:

    >>> reduced = fused_all_reduce(torch.tensor(5.0))
    >>> float(reduced)
    5.0

    A sequence of heterogeneously-shaped tensors round-trips to a list:

    >>> out = fused_all_reduce([torch.ones(2, 2), torch.tensor(5.0)])
    >>> [tuple(t.shape) for t in out]
    [(2, 2), ()]

    Integer bundles (counts, indices) reduce exactly in their own dtype:

    >>> reduced = fused_all_reduce({"count": torch.tensor([5, 3])})
    >>> reduced["count"].dtype, reduced["count"].tolist()
    (torch.int64, [5, 3])

    Asynchronous reduction returns a ``(result, work)`` pair; call ``wait``
    before reading ``result``. On a single process this is a no-op handle:

    >>> result, work = fused_all_reduce({"x": torch.tensor(1.0)}, async_op=True)
    >>> work.wait()
    True
    >>> float(result["x"])
    1.0
